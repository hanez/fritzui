# FritzUI

FritzUI is a GUI for managing your AVM Fritz!Box devices from remote using
the TR-064 protocol over UPnP. It is written in Python using the 
fritzconnection library.

This is totally new and not usable at the moment because it is a work in 
progress. I never wrote Python and GTK based software before so much I do
is new to me, but I have a plan how to succeed... :)

I wrote C and GTK based programs but Python really is different, but I love
it. So give me some time until a stable package will be released. If you 
want to be a part of this project, just contact me.
